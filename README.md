# Adversarial Robust Satellite Monitoring System

## Description
This project is a dual-purpose satellite monitoring system with adversarial robustness, using xView2 for disaster monitoring (UNet segmentation) and DOTA for defense monitoring (YOLOv5 object detection). It includes GANs for adversarial detection and reconstruction, and generates real-time alerts.

## Setup
- Python 3.10+
- Virtual environment: robust_monitoring_env
- Libraries: torch, opencv-python, etc.

## Usage
(To be added)

## Results
